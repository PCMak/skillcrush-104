			<h4>Beauty is in the eye of the beholder!</h4>
			<p>When you start writing your first code you are amaze that gobblely gook can look beautiful. Suddenly the realisation that you can convert coding into artform becomes real.</p>

	

			<h4>Burning the midnight oil!</h4>
			<p>The first home assignment was easy.  So is the second and then the third.  Hey, this was not supposed to be that EASY?  The desire to work through the hours even though you feel dog tired is hard to ignore. You decide to put in another half hour and call it quits.  Two hours later you're still hard away at the keyboard, tapping, return, tapping some more, return.  When is it going to end???</p>

			<p>This is a normal part of the process of learning a new technology, and in fact, it's a critical part of the process.</p>

	
<h4>What to do when you're about to throw it all in</h4>
<p>My personal experience has taken me from the depths of the lowest seabed to the highs of the Himalayan mountains.  Don't give up!  When you know that you're about to throw the towel in, go take a walk, smell the flowers, the air, even the traffic fumes.  Then return to the terminal the next day and tackle a little bit more.</p>
